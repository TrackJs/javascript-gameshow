Stuff to change/update since London 2023 Show:

1. Integrate the Audience App and the Presenter app so that we show the question on the big screen.
2. Find some way to show/explain the answers. Especially after game questions so there is a good transition.
3. Questions should be harder, and maybe back to 5.
4. Maybe have "themed" games--all equality questions, all math questions.
