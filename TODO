# Player Last Standing Elimination

When a player gets a "last standing" question wrong, they no longer get new active questions displayed. Instead, they get a "you have been eliminated" UI.

# Admin Last Standing Status

The admin should see how many players are still eligible in the last standing round, based on who has answered all the choice questions displayed so far correctly.

# How to handle complete elimination

When 0 players answer a last standing question correctly, we need to have a "redo" and let everyone answer another question

# How to handle a tie (stretch goal)

When more than 1 player answer all the last standing questions, what do we do? Show a text question? Show a bonus choice question? Just go off of time?
